                                    New Algorithm Vastly Improves Measurements of Sulfur Dioxide Pollution from Space

Advanced sensors including the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) flying on NASA's Aura spacecraft have been employed to measure SO<sub><small>2</small></sub> pollution. This however remains a challenging problem owing to relatively weak signals from most anthropogenic sources and various interferences such as ozone absorption and stray light.</p>
                                    <p>We have developed a fundamentally different approach for retrieving SO<sub><small>2</small></sub> from satellites.</p>

                                    <b>Our new approach has the following features:</b>

                                    NASA Satellite Sees Increase of India's Sulfur Dioxide Emissions
                                </div>
    
                                <div class="content" style="font-size: 14px;">
                                    <p>Power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide – an atmospheric pollutant with both health and climate impacts – have increased across India in recent years, according to a new analysis of data from a NASA satellite.</p>
                                    <p>While atmospheric sulfur dioxide is produced in nature primarily by volcanoes, humans emit it to the atmosphere from the combustion of fuels with significant amounts of sulfur-containing impurities and from the smelting of metals such as copper and nickel. The gas contributes to the formation of acid rain and in high concentrations can cause respiratory problems. It's also a precursor for one type of suspended particles, sulfate aerosols, which can affect the microphysical and optical properties of clouds, an effect that remains difficult to measure and a large cause of uncertainty in climate models.</p>
                                    <p>The scientists' look at India's sulfur dioxide emissions came two years after researchers developed a method to observe power plant emissions using measurements captured by an instrument on NASA's Aura satellite, launched in 2004. The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) measures ozone and other key air quality components including sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide, and collects data over the same locations at the same local time daily. OMI is a contribution of the Netherlands's Agency for Aerospace Programs in collaboration with the Finnish Meteorological Institute to the Aura mission.</p>
                                    <p>Results from the satellite analysis are in line with results of a ground-based inventory, which shows a 71 percent emission increase from 2005-2012. Lu and colleagues developed the ground-based inventory for previous work that used power plant- and unit-level information to calculate nitrogen oxide emissions. The researchers adapted the technique for application to sulfur dioxide emissions, and considered factors from boiler size to coal type to emission control technology.</p>

                                    <p>As most people who live near or drive by livestock farms know, ammonia (NH<sub><small>3</small></sub>) pungently affects air quality. It is also involved in the formation of  aerosol PM2.5 particles, which have adverse health effects, and impacts  soil acidification, biodiversity, and the nitrogen cycle.</p>
                                    <p>However, the widespread uncertainty in the magnitude and seasonality of ammonia emissions hinders the development of control measures.</p>
                                    <p>Aura Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) NH<sub><small>3</small></sub> data indicate that inventories of ammonia emissions are substantially lower than expected in several areas throughout the U.S.</p>

                                    <p> Aura's  Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) instrument focuses on  the Nitrogen dioxide (NO<small><sub>2</sub></small>) in  Southern California.    Nitrogen dioxide is more concentrated in more densely populated urban areas.   NO<small><sub>2</sub></small> forms quickly from emissions from cars, trucks and buses, power plants, and off-road equipment. In addition to contributing to the formation of ground-level ozone, and fine particle pollution, NO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is linked with a number of adverse effects.  </p>
                                    <p> Over the past several years, California has enforced aggressive air quality regulations.   Results of this action can be seen in Aura's OMI imagery below.  OMI shows that decreases in nitrogen dioxide (NO<small><sub>2</sub></small>) columns over the 4 years 2005-2008 approach 40%, almost the same as the weekend decrease observed in 2005.</p>
                                    <p>Vehicles have a much smaller impact on local air quality than they did 20 years ago, but their emissions of heattrapping gases have continue. Mobile sources including passenger vehicles account for approximately half of California's global warming pollution.</p>

                                    <p style="font-size: 12px;">Each year for the past few decades during the Southern Hemisphere spring, chemical reactions involving chlorine and bromine cause ozone in the southern polar region to be destroyed rapidly and severely. This depleted region is known as the “ozone hole”. The area of the ozone hole is determined from a map of total column ozone. It is calculated from the area on the Earth that is enclosed by a line with a constant value of 220 Dobson Units. The value of 220 Dobson Units is chosen since total ozone values of less than 220 Dobson Units were not found in the historic observations over Antarctica prior to 1979. Also, from direct measurements over Antarctica, a column ozone level of less than 220 Dobson Units is a result of the ozone loss from chlorine and bromine compounds.</p>
