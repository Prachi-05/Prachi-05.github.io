                                   <p>The CloudSat S/C, built by BATC (Ball Aerospace & Technology Corporation), uses a BCP 2000 series bus of QuikSCAT and ICESat heritage (also referred to as RS 2000 bus). The S/C is three-axis inertially stabilized (momentum biased), the ADCS (Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem) uses a star tracker (one redundant) and 14 coarse sun sensors, which also provide sun direction for solar array control, and three two-axis magnetometers. Actuation is provided by 3 dual-winding torque rods and 4 reaction wheels. The pointing accuracy is ≤ 0.07º, two-axes, 99.7% probable; the geolocation knowledge of the radar footprint position is better than 1 km on the geoid, two-axes, 99.7% probable. Two global positioning system receivers (C/A code capability) provide GPS time and position and velocity to the onboard location determination process.

                                   <p>One of the most remarkable achievements by the CloudSat science team is the development of precipitation profile products. Over the years, rainfall modeling has been challenging—and snowfall modeling has been even more difficult. CloudSat observations have changed that. CloudSat rainfall data have been available since 2007; more recently, the first-ever global estimate of snowfall has become available. Both products are now standard data outputs from CloudSat and CALIPSO observations and have opened the doors to new insights on how and where precipitation falls, globally.<p>

Joaquin contained maximum sustained winds of 100 km/hr with a minimum central pressure of 992 mb. CloudSat overpassed directly through the center on convection of Tropical Storm Joaquin.<p>
                                   
                                     <p>MODIS on NASA's Aqua satellite captured the infrared (Figure 9) image taken a few minutes before the CloudSat overpass  denoted by the blue line A->B). The enhanced infrared VIIRS imagery of Suomi-NPP also shows the CloudSat track during the same time period. This imagery distinguishes between cold and warm cloud top temperatures using IR imagery (higher cloud tops -> colder temperatures).

                                     <p>CloudSat intersected Tropical Storm Joaquin just as the storm was starting to become better organized. The upper level wind environment was becoming more favorable for storm development along with warm SSTs (Sea Surface Temperatures) to fuel intensification. The CloudSat profile reveals a broad area of deep convection in the northern section of the storm. The CloudSat overpass (Figure 10) intersects a dense section of moderate to heavy rain and deep convection with some of the stronger convective cores bubbling through the cirrus shield (light pink and dark red areas indicate the largest amount of ice/water). The CloudSat cloud profiling signal attenuates in areas of moderate to heavy precipitation (diminished signal from the surface to 5-6 km).<p>

At 750 m resolution the imagery emphasizes the colder temperatures and highest cloud tops. Areas of bubbling convection are distinguishable (-80ºC) that are yellow in color.<p>

                                    <p> The global energy balance of the Earth-atmosphere system: Perhaps the most compact way to summarize the importance of the scientific achievements from the first decade of the CloudSat and CALIPSO missions is by revisiting the planetary global energy balance. Clouds play several important roles in modulating how energy moves through Earth’s atmosphere: by reflecting sunlight, emitting infrared energy back to the surface as part of Earth’s greenhouse effect, and releasing energy into the atmosphere as water vapor condenses to form cloud droplets and precipitation. Other instruments (e.g., CERES) have also been able to measure total energy flows into and out of the atmosphere. But CERES data suffered from the limitations common to all passive measurements. Until the arrival of CloudSat and CALIPSO, the impacts of clouds on radiant energy remained difficult to quantify in part because not all clouds could be identified from space and, in part, becaus                                                                 e passive measurements could not always accurately characterize the composition of those clouds.

                                   <p> CloudSat mission carries a number of benefits: 1) allowing for new science in the context of weather and climate variability and also enabling new products, 2) uninterrupted applications to aviation and weather forecasting, 3) improved understanding of seasonal and inter-annual variations in cloud behavior, 4) enhanced data for evaluating model behavior, and 5) providing calibration for future missions such as EarthCARE (2016) and GPM (2014). There is also strong synergy with the future OCO-2 mission as the oxygen A-band from OCO-2 provides complementary information on clouds.<p>
                                    </p> CloudSat has provided the first real information on the fraction of clouds that produce precipitation. Over the Earth's oceans, CloudSat has shown that precipitation is much more common than was previously thought, due to the fact that precipitation over oceans is extremely hard to measure and that the light rain that often falls has been completely missed by satellite observations until now. CloudSat has shown that almost 15% of all oceanic clouds produce rain that falls to the surface. This is a fraction larger than previously believed and has much significance for improved understanding of the Earth's hydrological cycle. Globally averaged, approximately 12% of all clouds are producing rain. This quantity was unknown previous to CloudSat observations.<p>
