                                    NASA's AIRS Captures Polar Vortex Moving in Over US

                                    <p>The U.S. Midwest has been gripped by the lowest temperatures it has seen in years. An unusually cold Arctic air mass, called a polar vortex, is responsible for the severe temperatures, which in many areas have plunged well below 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius).</p>
                                    <p>NASA's Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument aboard the Aqua satellite captured the polar vortex as it moved southward from central Canada into the U.S. Midwest from Jan. 20 through Jan. 29. The illustration shows temperatures at an altitude of about 10,000 to 15,000 feet (600 millibars atmospheric pressure) above the ground. The lowest temperatures are shown in purple and blue and range from -40 degrees Fahrenheit (also -40 degrees Celsius) to -10 degrees Fahrenheit (-23 degrees Celsius). As the data series progresses, you can see how the coldest purple areas of the air mass scoop down into the U.S.</p>
                                    <p>The polar vortex is responsible for a number of deaths, disruptions to services, and energy outages in the affected areas.</p>

                                    <p>The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder or AIRS instrument aboard NASA's Aqua satellite passed over Hurricane Maria on Sept. 25 at 2:11 p.m. EDT (1811 UTC) and analyzed the storm in infrared light. Infrared light provides scientists with temperature data, important when trying to understand storm intensity. The lowest temperatures, in dark purple, are associated with the high, cold cloud tops of powerful thunderstorms with heavy rainfall potential. So infrared light as that gathered by the AIRS instrument can identify the strongest sides of a tropical cyclone. The AIRS image clearly showed the bulk of strong storms in Maria's northeastern quadrant as well as in the storms surrounding the eye.</p>

                                    Carbon Monoxide in the Mid-Troposphere over Indonesia Fires

                                    <p>In 2015, widespread forest fires across Indonesia burned tens of thousands of acres over three months, causing high levels of pollution, loss of life, and billions of dollars to the Indonesian government. Most of the fires are believed to have been set to clear farmland during the dry season, but a long term drought enhanced by strong El Niño conditions contributed to the fires remaining unchecked due to lack of rain.</p>
<p>This image, made with data acquired by AIRS, the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder on NASA's Aqua Satellite, shows the global concentration of carbon monoxide at the 500hPa pressure level, or approximately 18,000 feet (5,500 meters) altitude. The data are an average of measurements taken over three days, from October 26 through 28, and the high concentration and large extent of the fires over Indonesia are quite apparent. While the scale for this image extends to 400 parts per billion, local values of carbon monoxide can be significantly higher.</p>

                                    <p>While people in the eastern two-thirds of the U.S have been dealing with Arctic Air, the bulge in the jet stream over the eastern Pacific Ocean has been keeping the western third of the U.S. in warmer than normal temperatures over the last two months. Infrared data from NASA provided a look at those surface temperature extremes from west to east.</p>
                                    <p>“It’s the weather-controlling polar jet stream – a fast river of wind in the upper atmosphere – that has been locked in an extreme pattern for the past few years," explained Climatologist Bill Patzert of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. "Rather than circling in a relatively straight path, the jet stream has meandered in great north-south waves. In the west, it’s been bulging northward, arguably for the past two winters – a pattern meteorologists have nick named the 'Ridiculously Resilient Ridge.' Over frigid northern Canada, the jet takes a hard right turn and plunges into the upper Midwest and East Coast, plummeting temperatures and creating punishing ice and snow storms.”</p>
                                    <p>On February 18, when the AIRS data was taken, the high temperature in Los Angeles, California reached 75F. That was one of 10 days out of the first 20 days of February, where temperatures reached or passed that mark in the city.</p>

                                    <p>When glaciers grind against underlying bedrock, they produce a silty powder with grains finer than sand. Geologists call it “glacial flour” or “rock flour.” This iron- and feldspar-rich substance often finds its way into rivers and lakes, coloring the water brown, grey, or aqua. When water levels are low, the flour can dry out on riverbanks and deltas and become dust for winds to lift into the air.</p>
                                    <p>That’s what was happening on October 28, 2014, when the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Aqua satellite captured this image of northerly winds blowing dust from the Copper River Delta over the Gulf of Alaska. Dust events are most common in this area in the fall, when river and lake levels in south central Alaska are at their lowest. Another period of high dust activity occurs in late winter and early spring.</p>
                                    <p>“One of the reasons dust events are particularly interesting in this part of the world is that they may be activating dormant phytoplankton in the Gulf of Alaska in ways that are having significant effects on marine ecosystems,” explained Gassó. “But we really need more observations with satellites—and especially by people on the ground and at sea—to determine if there is a relationship.”</p>

                                    <p>While the northern latitudes are bathed in the dull colors and light of mid-winter, the waters of the southern hemisphere are alive with mid-summer blooms. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Aqua satellite acquired this natural-color satellite image of a plankton bloom as it appeared at 1:05 p.m. local time on December 30, 2013. The eddy is centered at roughly 40° South latitude and 120° East longitude, about 600 kilometers off the coast of Australia in the southeastern Indian Ocean.</p>
                                    <p>It is possible that the mesoscale eddy and plankton bloom shown above are related to the “great southern coccolithophore belt” (or the “great calcite belt.”) In late southern spring and summer (roughly November to March), satellite instruments detect an abundance of particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) in waters at high latitudes. The PIC is often due to calcium carbonate, which makes up the plate-like shells of microscopic plankton known as coccolithophores. The calcium carbonate gives the water a chalky aquamarine hue.</p>

At that time Haiyan was located over the central Philippines and was quickly heading towards the west at 22 knots (25 mph). The lowest temperatures, in dark purple, are associated with the high, cold cloud tops of powerful thunderstorms with heavy rainfall potential. The Philippine islands stretch from the center of the image to the northwest. Northern Indonesia is at the bottom of the image, and northeastern Malaysia is at the lower left of the image. Some of the Philippine regions being pounded by the storm, in the area with purple coloring, are the Visayas, Bicol, National Capital, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, Northern Mindanao, and Mimaropa regions.</p>

                                    <p>This map created with data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on NASA's Aqua satellite shows the concentration of carbon dioxide in Earth's mid-troposphere, located roughly between 3 to 6 miles (5 to 9 kilometers) in altitude. Darker red colors correspond to higher concentrations of carbon dioxide, which are seen mostly in the northern latitudes. This is a typical pattern for this time of year, which follows the die-off of vegetation in winter when soil and plants release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Much of the regional variability seen in this map is due to weather patterns that move higher concentrations of carbon dioxide from Earth's surface into and out of the mid-troposphere where the AIRS instrument detects carbon dioxide best. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the mid-troposphere lags the concentration found at the surface as mixing from the lower to upper altitudes usually takes days to weeks. In addition, changes in concentration of carbon dioxide at Earth's surface are not always carried up to higher altitudes.</p>

                                    <p>Sanvu first formed as a tropical depression over the western Pacific Ocean on May 21, 2012, strengthened to a tropical storm the same day, and became a typhoon two days later. On May 25, 2012, the U.S. Navy’s Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) reported that Sanvu was located roughly 100 nautical miles (185 kilometers) southwest of Iwo Jima (Iwo To), Japan. The storm had maximum sustained winds of 80 knots (150 kilometers per hour) and gusts up to 100 knots (185 kilometers per hour).</p>
                                    <p>The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Aqua satellite acquired this natural-color image of Typhoon Sanvu on May 25. The typhoon’s spiral arms extended over Iwo Jima and nearby islands.</p>
                                    <p>As of May 25, the JTWC’s projected storm track for Sanvu showed the storm moving toward the northeast, over the open Pacific Ocean. Wind speeds were expected to gradually decrease over the next couple days.</p>

                                    <p>Haze hugged mountain slopes and filled valleys in eastern China in late October 2011. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Aqua satellite took this image on October 30.</p>
                                    <p>An arc of haze extends hundreds of kilometers southwest of the capital city of Beijing, which lies just off the northeastern edge of the image. Especially thick haze hovers over the city of Xi’an. High ridges poke above the haze, which appears confined to lower elevations. The haze likely results from urban and industrial pollution</p>
