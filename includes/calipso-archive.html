                                    <p>The data in this transect reveal the height of the dust over the Dominican Republic as observed by the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) instrument on the CALIPSO satellite on June 23, 2020. Reaching roughly 4 kilometers (2.5 miles), the top of the plume was a bit higher than most; there was also plenty of dust at or below 1 kilometer (0.6 miles). As dust crosses the ocean, larger particles fall out first, leaving behind mainly finer and smaller ones, which are especially problematic for human health</p>
                                    <p>Air pollution experts are not the
                                        only specialists who are closely following this event. Meteorologists
                                        track dust storms because the dry, dusty air can inhibit the formation
                                        of clouds and prevent hurricanes. Infectious disease researchers watch
                                        them because dust plumes can be vectors for viral and bacterial
                                        diseases. And climate scientists study dust because big events can
                                        absorb enough light to affect Earth’s <a target="_blank" href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/EnergyBalance/page1.php" name="0.1.FDCNPZ.NFMN2D.PE2QCQ.A">radiation budget</a>.

                                        creatures – from squid to krill – swim from the ocean
                                        depths to near the surface to feed. This vast animal migration —a critical part of Earth’s - the largest on the planet and a critical part of Earth’s climate system (<a target="_blank" href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/CarbonCycle" name="0.1.FDCNPZ.TIIJTH.M2AZ1Q.B">carbon cycle</a>) — has been observed globally for the first time thanks to an unexpected use of a space-based laser.

                                    <p>Researchers observed this vertical migration pattern using the CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations) satellite — a joint venture between NASA and the French space agency, CNES (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales) — that launched in 2006. They published their findings in the journal Nature Wednesday.</p>

                                        to the CALIPSO satellite. Scientists examined data from the day and
                                        night passes of the satellite and noted the difference in the amount of
                                        backscattering. Areas colored red or orange had the greatest difference
                                        in light scattering, a signal that indicates significant numbers of
                                        migrating marine creatures in those areas.</p>

                                    <p>This animal-mediated carbon conveyor belt is recognized as an important mechanism in Earth’s carbon cycle. Scientists are adding animals that undergo DVM as a key element in climate models.</p>
                                    <p> "What these modelers haven't had is a global dataset to calibrate these models with, to tell them where these migrators are most important, where they're most abundant, and how they change over time," said Behrenfeld. "The new satellite data give us an opportunity to combine satellite observations with the models and do a better job quantifying the impact of this enormous animal migration on Earth’s carbon cycle."</p>
                                    <p> The satellite data are also relevant to global fisheries because the migrating animals are an important food source for larger predators that lurk in the depths of the ocean. Those predators are often species of fish that are attractive to commercial fisheries. The larger the DVM signal, the larger the population of fish that can live in the deep sea.</p>
                                    <p>Though CALIPSO's laser was designed to measure clouds and atmospheric aerosols, it can penetrate the upper 20 meters of the ocean's surface layer. If the migrating animals reach this layer, they are detected by CALIPSO.</p>
                                    <p>Researchers used the space-based CALIPSO lidar to measure the planet’s largest animal migration, which takes place when small sea creatures swim up from the depths at night to feed on phytoplankton, then back down again just before sunrise</p>

                                   <p>The Lidar In-space Technology Experiment (LITE), developed and built at Langley, was the principal payload on space shuttle Discovery during STS-64. Between Sept. 9 and 20, 1994, LITE operated for 53 hours, collected more than 40 gigabytes of data (a lot for the time), and covered 1.4 million kilometers of ground track.</p>
                                   <p>- They succeeded beyond their
                                    expectations. Instead of flat, two-dimensional imagery, LITE revealed
                                    intricate multi-layer cloud structures resembling works of art. The
                                    instrument literally gave researchers a new way of looking at Earth's
                                    atmosphere from space and in doing so laid the groundwork for future
                                    lidar missions. The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder
                                    Satellite Observation (<a target="_blank" href="https://www-calipso.larc.nasa.gov/" name="0.1.FDCNPZ.58FEZO.7Y0Q1Q.81">CALIPSO</a>), a joint satellite mission between NASA and the French space agency (CNES) that launched in 2006 and is still flying today, was a direct descendant of LITE. Also descended from LITE were the two Ice, Cloud and land Elevation satellites (<a target="_blank" href="https://icesat.gsfc.nasa.gov/" name="0.1.FDCNPZ.58FEZO.7Y0Q1Q.91">ICESat</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://icesat-2.gsfc.nasa.gov/" name="0.1.FDCNPZ.58FEZO.7Y0Q1Q.A1">ICESat-2</a>), Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (<a target="_blank" href="https://gedi.umd.edu/" name="0.1.FDCNPZ.58FEZO.7Y0Q1Q.B1">GEDI</a>), and the Cloud-Aerosol Transport Systems (<a target="_blank" href="https://cats.gsfc.nasa.gov/" name="0.1.FDCNPZ.58FEZO.7Y0Q1Q.C1">CATS</a>).

                                   <p> CloudSat and CALIPSO were designed to complement each other in the 1990s. They launched together on the same rocket in 2006. Then they spent more than 10 years orbiting Earth in formation with a coterie of other satellites in what's known as the A-Train, or afternoon constellation.</p>
                                   <p> In the A-Train, measurements from CloudSat's radar and CALIPSO's lidar were combined to revolutionize the way scientists see clouds and the tiny particles suspended in the atmosphere collectively known as aerosols. Scientists have long known that there are important interrelationships between clouds and aerosols, but prior to the launch of CALIPSO and CloudSat, did not have the tools to understand how they interact.</p>
                                   <p>CloudSat and CALIPSO orbited and took measurements together for almost 12 years in the A-Train. Then, in February 2018, facing a mechanical challenge, CloudSat had to exit the A-Train, moving to a lower orbit — leaving CALIPSO behind and the future of their partnership uncertain.  Following an exit maneuver of its own in September, CALIPSO (foreground) has joined CloudSat, forming what NASA scientists are calling the C-Train.</p>

Data from the CALIPSO lidar and CloudSat radar appear as vertical slices in the atmosphere. CALIPSO lidar data is visualized as a bluish slice, with red and yellow colors denoting more scattering off of clouds and aerosols. CloudSat radar data is superimposed on the CALIPSO slice in brighter colors. Areas of heavier precipitation, found in each storm’s spiral bands, appear in red and pink.</p>

                                   <p>The map shows the distribution of vertical migrators in the world’s oceans, with brighter colors indicating greater abundance. In looking for patterns across the study period (2008-2017), the researchers found that while there are fewer vertically migrating animals in the lower-nutrient and clearer waters of tropical and subtropical ocean regions, they make up a much greater fraction of the total animal population in these regions. In murkier and more nutrient-rich regions (mostly higher latitudes), the abundance of animals that undergo DVM is higher, but they also represent a smaller fraction of the total animal population because more animals stay near the surface by day and night.</p>
