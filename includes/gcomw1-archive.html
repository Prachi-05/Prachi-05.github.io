                                    <p>Australia has naturally faced many droughts and bushfires, but conditions have been unusually severe this time. Sometime around September 2019, the bushfires continuously occurred around the state of New South Wales in southeast Australia. The fires had been spreading on a larger scale, and a number of massive fires had merged into a "Mega Fire" that was out of control. The fires are unlikely to end entirely even at the end of January 2020.</p>
                                    <p> Bushfires cause not only personal and economic damages, but also environmental degradation for many animals and discharging carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. There are growing concerns about serious damage to habitats for wild animals including koalas, too. This article introduces the results of diversified analysis on the bushfires by using multi-satellite data.</p>
                                    <p>One of the backgrounds of the forest files is the condition of "drought" especially in eastern Australia, which has very little rain compared with normal year. JAXA has generated and provided global precipitation distribution data called "Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP)" using multiple satellite data, such as the Global Precipitation Measurement(GPM) and Global Change Observation Mission-Water "Shizuku” (GCOM-W). GSMaP data are available since March 2000 and can be utilized in statistical analysis because it has a long-term data set containing satellite precipitation data with less than twenty years. EORC tried to detect drought happened in Australia by calculating Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) from GSMaP. SPI is the statistical exponent by which we can evaluate drought only using precipitation amount.</p>

                                    <p>In Hokkaido, drift ice can be seen floating across the Okhotsk Sea, which is located in the northeastern part of Japan. The drift ice season is from January to March, with its peak in February. Drift ice-watching tours start at Hokkaido.</p>
                                    <p>The GCOM-W satellite and its payload are operating nominally in February 2018. Considering the good health of the satellite and instrument and the status of the onboard consumables, the project plans to continue the GCOM-W mission operations as long as possible to avoid/minimize an observation gap between the AMSR2 (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2) and the follow-on sensor. — A major objective of the mission is also to provide continuous observations of the global water cycle succeeding role of JAXA’s AMSR-E (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - for EOS) on the NASA's Aqua satellite. Note: AMSR-E ended its operational support on 4 Dec. 2015 after more than 9 years of service on Aqua.</p>
                                    <p> In May 2017, the GCOM-W mission passed its on-orbit design life goal of 5 years.</p>

                                    <p>Every year, the process is generally the same: the cap of sea ice on the Arctic Ocean melts and retreats through spring and summer to an annual minimum extent. Then, as the ocean and air cool with autumn, ice cover grows again and the cycle continues. But when we take a look at smaller regions within the Arctic, we get a more detailed picture of what’s been going on.</p>
                                    <p>The map in Figure shows the extent of Arctic sea ice on September 13, 2017, when the ice reached its minimum extent for the year. Extent is defined as the total area in which the ice concentration is at least 15 percent. The map was compiled from observations by the AMSR-2 (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 instrument on the GCOM -W1 (Global Change Observation Mission 1st-Water)/Shizuku satellite mission operated by JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency). The yellow outline in Figure shows the median sea ice extent observed in September from 1981 through 2010.</p>

                                    <p>According to the NSIDC (National Snow and Ice Data Center) in Boulder, CO, the Arctic sea ice cover in 2017 shrank to 4.64 million km2, the eighth-lowest extent in the 39-year satellite record. Charting these annual minimums and maximums has revealed a steep decline in overall Arctic sea ice in the satellite era. But the decline is not the same everywhere across the Arctic Ocean. The Beaufort Sea north of Alaska, for example, is the region where sea ice has been retreating the fastest.</p>
                                    <p>This year, ice in the Chukchi and Beaufort and seas reached their minimum extents toward the end of September, later than the Arctic as a whole. The graph of Figure 11 shows the ice in these two seas was still declining while other regions had started freezing. The melting persisted the longest in the Beaufort Sea, which finally started to refreeze after reaching a minimum on September 27. Data for the graph come from the NSIDC MASIE (Multi-sensor Analyzed Sea Ice Extent) product, which is based on operational sea ice analyses produced by the U.S. National Ice Center. Note: the MASIE observations included also the SSM/I instrument on the DMSP series. In addition, in situ measurements were used.</p>
                                    <p> Ice loss is the Beaufort and Chukchi seas was not record-breaking this year, but the extents were much lower than usual. Notice in the map how the ice edge in these seas was farther north than average. According to Walt Meier, a scientist at the NSIDC (National Snow and Ice Data Center), the Chukchi and Beaufort seas entered the melt season with a lot of first-year ice. This ice type is generally thinner than multi-year or perennial ice (which survived the previous melt season); first-year ice tends to melt away more easily.</p>
                                    <p>Meier also notes that low-pressure weather systems persisted near the North Pole for much of the summer. “Low pressure will keep things cooler overall and generally will lead to a relatively higher ice extent overall,” Meier said. “However, the position of the low this year led to winds blowing from the south and west that help move ice out of these regions. Also, the winds may have helped to bring in warmer ocean waters from the Bering Strait region as well.”</p>

                                        Antarctica’s Larsen C iceberg on July 12, 2017. The AMSR-2
                                        (Advance Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2) on JAXA’s Shizuku
                                        satellite captured the calving of the close to 5,800 km<sup>2</sup> chunk of ice. The nascent iceberg created by the rift is estimated to weigh over a trillion tons.</p>
                                    <p>AMSR-2 was instrumental in grasping this major calving event. It can turn to and observe the same area a few times a day regardless of time and weather. Antarctica is currently in its winter, the season of six-month-long darkness. AMSR-2’s high temporal resolution could monitor the progression of the rift despite the absence of light, which the traditional optical sensors cannot.</p>

                                   <p> Global sea ice extent hit record low, according to observations from Shizuku on GCOM (Global Change Observation Mission) on January 14, 2017. It is an all time low in the history of satellite operation that started in 1978, JAXA continues operation of Shizuku and GCOM-C and monitoring arctic sea ice extent, off the coast of Greenland Sea and the rest of the arctic circle.</p>

                                   <p>JAXA/EORC (Earth Observation Research Center) has developed GSMaP (Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation) realtime version (GSMaP_NOW) providing rainfall information of current hour, and released those information through a new webpage “JAXA Realtime Rainfall Watch”. While GSMaP near-real-time version (GSMaP_NRT) is provided with a 4 hour data latency, which consists of 3 hour for data gathering and 1 hour for processing, GSMaP_NOW is provided in quasi-realtime and updated every half hour. For example, hourly GSMaP_NOW image and data during 09:30Z and 10:29Z is available at around 10:30Z through the web site.</p>
                                   <p>GSMaP_NOW produces rainfall map over the area of geostationary satellite "Himawari", using passive microwave observations that are available within half-hour after observation (GMI, AMSR2 near Japan, and AMSU direct receiving data). Furthermore, half-hour extrapolation of rainfall map toward future direction by using cloud moving vector from the geostationary satellite allows us to estimate "current" rainfall map at every half-hour.</p>
